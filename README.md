# Fire_Fighting_Robot

This is an autonomous robot that can manoeuver obstacles while patrolling a given perimeter. If fire is detected while patrolling, the robot moves towards the fire and attempts to extinguish it.
After the fire has been extinguished, the robot returns to it's patrolling duties.
I later added a gas detector to detect flammable gases and sends an alert signal.
